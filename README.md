# Deploying an Application with Terraform on AWS

This project contains Terraform code to provision resources in an AWS environment. It sets up infrastructure and deploys an application using the specified configuration.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files:

- `main.tf`: This file contains the main configuration for the project. It defines the resources to be provisioned in the AWS environment.

- `provider-aws.tf`: This file specifies the AWS provider configuration for Terraform. It sets up the access key, secret key, and region for AWS.

- `variables.tf`: This file defines the variables used in the Terraform project. It includes variables for AWS credentials, application settings, and other configurable options.

- `terraform.tfvars.example`: This file provides an example of how to configure the variables for the Terraform project. It serves as a template for creating the actual `terraform.tfvars` file.

- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project. It provides an overview of the project structure and instructions on how to use and configure the Terraform code.

Please note that the actual `terraform.tfvars` file is not included in the project tree structure, as it typically contains sensitive information such as access keys and secret keys. It should be created separately and kept secure.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Populate the AWS credentials in the `terraform.tfvars` file. You can use the `terraform.tfvars.example` file as a template.

3. Modify the `main.tf` file to customize the infrastructure and resources to be provisioned.

4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform project.

5. Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan for the Terraform code.

6. Run `terraform apply` to provision the resources in the AWS environment.

7. After the resources are provisioned, you can access and manage them through the AWS console or other AWS tools.
